# Build-A-Bot
## Suggestions
Area for which all suggestions to the concepts, product, code, and any other elements of the project will be contained.
### Concepts
In this critique, some critiques will overflow to other personas on the same concept, so they will not be repeated.
- Perspective from the side of a Prompt Engineer/Developer/Project Manager/Company (I group it together here as they will likely seek similar objectives):
  - “Bot” concept: Overall, as a prompt engineer, I can understand and see what every single description of said concept tries to accomplish, though I struggle to comprehend what bot templates you are referring to, i.e. I am not told how they will be created for me to use as a prompt engineer. The simple description of what they consist doesn’t tell me how these will come together to help me design bots.
  - The “Bot Template” concept: As a prompt engineer, a description of how these templates will be available for personas such as myself to pick and choose these different elements that make up the bot template as a whole would be beneficial for clarification.
  - “Brains” concept: I think adding a concept for “System” would be helpful to describe what the system would be made up of for ease of understanding. Also, as a prompt engineer, I want to know how broad the customization of specific behaviors will be so I can understand the scope of functionality.
  - “Tools” concept: As a prompt engineer, I want to know how tools can enhance my creation of certain bots, which would be helpful to be included here.
  - “Conversation History” concept: Creating a concept for “Chats” would probably help me understand more of how your idea of how many different bots will interact with one another to produce chats in response to prompts will be beneficial.
  - “Generalized Models” concept: Tell me what all these models have in common that would prompt them to be grouped in this list.
  - “Specialized Models” concept: Same idea as above, tell me what these all have in common.
  - “Socially Engaging” concept: As a prompt engineer, I want to know a more in depth description of what it means to engage with the user. Tell me how the design will work to allow me to create more engaging bots on a more specific and descriptive basis than just “other things,” as providing me information on only images doesn’t tell me too much other than just that. I am struggling to envision a broader scope of what this entails.
  - “Privacy” concept: This makes sense, I would also add that PII would not be collected outside of making the bots have increased accuracy and users can choose to turn off any data collection whatsoever to ensure full privacy. This is how most companies will tend to do things, and what is seen as most acceptable.
  - “Users” concept: This is simple enough, although to add necessary critique, I would speak on the matter of the objective of adding more accounts based on certain prerequisites or to not add anymore because of x, y, z.
  - “Authentication” concept: I would really consider making this more clear and explain on a specific basis as to how you are looking to achieve this objective. As in, what methods are you looking to employ to ensure you can authenticate. Likely, you can say email authentication or microsoft 2fa.
  - “Authorization” concept: Same idea, be more descriptive as how to how you plan to achieve this. As a company or developer, I need to know how you plan to work this out; otherwise, I will be unsure of how trustworthy or secure this system is outside of just mentioning API keys.
  - “API Keys” concept: Mention how API keys will also pertain to personas outside of users, mention how every role will have access to make it more clear and comprehensive.
